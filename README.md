# CallenculatorV2

This is yet another calculator program. A much more organized program using objects from python. Instead of struggling with finding the right symbols for operators, this second version of my calculator now asks which calculator the user wants to use:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

The user now only needs to type the corresponding number in order to use that calculator. The calculator is divided into 3 files:
- 1. For the main calculator itself
- 2. For looping the program
- 3. For launching the program

With that said, I hope you like my program.
